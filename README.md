# Lomekwi

The best way to describe Lomekwi is with a little story.

This society is divided in groups. Each member of the group has a bag of artefacts and every group has a leader. The leader is responsible for keeping the group safe, which means that it controls the artefacts of the group. A new member only enters the group if everyone accepts it. The bag of artefacts is used when a member wants to add a new item to the group. This item is then given to the leader, who breaks this item into multiple artefacts and distributes these artefacts within the group. When someone wants to get and item, it asks for it for the group leader, who collects the artefacts, mount the item and give to that member. If a leader is found dead or unreachable, the group make an election to select a new leader. Groups can share items with each other, they do that by establishing connections between group leaders.
