SplitBit is a distributed shared file system. It splits the files into encrypted artifacts and distribute them between the system members. This makes every member to use the same amount of disk space and keeps everything safe, since you need to mount all the artifacts of a file to decrypt it. If a file is needed the member collects all the artifacts from other members and mount the file.
